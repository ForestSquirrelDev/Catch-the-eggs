This is a very tiny project that was intended to be a test assignment. The task was to replicate old classic game "The wolf and the eggs", using Unity.
Timespan for this task was strictly 3 hours. Of which 1.5 hours i was looking for the proper assets on the internet, lol. So you can count this project as made in
1.5 hours. At the point of doing this project i had less than one year of experience in Unity. 

Given all that, i believe the result to be pretty satisfying. And so did the reviewer at the time.
Gameloop feels nice and non-bloated, and it actually plays like a proper game.

You can try it yourself on itch:
